Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.

Unordered lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens -- interchangably -- as list markers. Here's one using asterisks: 

 *   Red
 *   Green
 *   Blue

and this one uses pluses:

 +   Red
 +   Green
 +   Blue

and finally hyphens:

 -   Red
 -   Green
 -   Blue

Ordered lists use numbers followed by periods:

 1.  Bird
 2.  McHale
 3.  Parish

You do not need to increment the number:

 1.  Bird
 1.  McHale
 1.  Parish

or even have any order:

 3. Bird
 1. McHale
 8. Parish

You would still get the same thing.
